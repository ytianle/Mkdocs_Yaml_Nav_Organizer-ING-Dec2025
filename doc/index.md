# MkDocs Nav Manager

> A Confluence-like page tree editor for MkDocs that keeps `mkdocs.yml` and your docs folder in sync.

## Demo flow
1. Create a new Section + Page
2. Drag & drop to reorder or nest
3. Rename title / folder / filename inline
4. Undo / redo (tree + filesystem)

## Key guarantees
- All edits auto-sync `mkdocs.yml` + files
- If a target path already exists, sync is blocked and nothing is written
